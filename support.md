# Phototag Support Documentation

Welcome to the support page for PhotoEase, your go-to tool for organizing photos and live-photos efficiently.

## Features Overview

Phototag is designed to simplify the organization of photos and live photos on your device. With intuitive gestures and features, you can efficiently categorize, favorite, and manage your memories.

### Photo Management

On the Home page, photos are displayed individually for easy organization. Selected albums appear at the bottom, allowing for quick categorization.


- **Swipe Left/Right**: Navigate between photos.
- **Double Tap**: Toggle marking a photo as a favorite.
- **Swipe Down**: Organize the current photo into selected albums. If no albums are chosen, the app will set the photo aside.
- **Swipe Up**: Send the photo to the trash. Access trashed photos by tapping the trash icon at the top right. From there, permanently delete or recover them. Deleted photos are moved to the system's deleted album.
- **Long Press (Live Photos)**: Play the live photo.

For any missteps, use the undo button at the top left to reverse your last action.

### Album Management

Manage and prioritize your albums for a tailored experience.

#### Sections:

- Top Section: Highlight your preferred albums. These will be displayed on the Home page for easy photo organization.
- Secondary Section: Albums here won't appear on the Home page but can be managed and prioritized as needed.

#### Album Actions:

- Create: Add new albums. They'll be created on your device once photos are added.
- Delete: This action hides the album within the app, not on your device. It ensures a clutter-free experience by removing seldom-used albums from view.
